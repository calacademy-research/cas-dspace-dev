This is an image of my working directory - this work is compelte; it's preserved for posterity. Very very obvious junk has been removed. Obvious junk is probably still here. subtle junk will live forever.

The most intereting files are the converters - things with .py suffiexes - and the sample dspace ready SAF in ./cumulus.
