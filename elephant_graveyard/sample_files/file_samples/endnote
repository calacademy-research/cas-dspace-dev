TI A note on the article "A robust branch-and-cut approach for the
   minimum-energy symmetric network connectivity problem"
SO OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB In the paper Li et al. [A robust branch-and-cut approach for the minimum-energy symmetric network connectivity problem. Omega 2012;40:210-7] it is claimed that a theoretical result appeared in Montemanni and Gambardella [Exact algorithms for the minimum power symmetric connectivity problem in wireless networks. Computers and Operations Research 2005;32:2891-904] is wrong. In this note we show that the original result is correct, and that the counter-example used to prove the wrongness of the original result is incorrect. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Instructing ICT Lessons in Primary Schools: Teachers' Opinions and
   Applications
SO KURAM VE UYGULAMADA EGITIM BILIMLERI
AB Regarding the use of information and communication technologies, acquiring basic knowledge and skills has become a necessity. Schools offer ICT lessons to young generations in order to enable them to use of ICTs effectively. But there are uncertainties about this relatively new lesson concerning effectiveness of the lesson and about how instruction of this lesson has been made. The aim of this study was to investigate how ICT lessons in primary schools are taught. In order to reach this goal, opinions of 51 computer teachers were collected through a survey questionnaire and analyzed by using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. According to the results the most frequently used methods by computer teachers were demonstration and 'practice, Q&A and lecturing methods. In terms of teaching materials, teachers reported that they were most frequently using textbook. There are two basic approaches used for software instruction in ICI lessons: demonstration & practice and use of written instructions. Some of the participant teachers reported that they preferred to use both approaches eclectically. According to the findings, the time duration allocated for this lesson is the most significant basic problem stated by the teachers in terms of implementing the curriculum prepared by the Ministry of National Education.

TI A Blended Learning Experience
SO KURAM VE UYGULAMADA EGITIM BILIMLERI
AB Blended (hybrid) learning is one of the approaches that is utilized to help students for meaningful learning via information and communication technologies in educational settings. In this study, Computer)) Course which is taught in faculties of education was planned and implemented in the form of a blended learning environment. The data were collected from freshman students of departments of mathematics and primary school education via a semi-structured survey which included open and closed-ended questions at the end of the implementation. The students were taking the course for the first time, and they were introduced with a blended learning environment for the first time with this course. The survey was conducted online and 67 students completed the survey voluntarily, and the data were subjected to content analysis. According to the results, implementing the course especially with electronic activities had positive effects on students from a learning and evaluation perspective. Students stated that the blended learning environment supported their active participation to the course activities and indicated that following the content of the course, homework and projects online was interesting and useful.

TI ICT Teachers' Assigned Roles and Expectations from Them
SO KURAM VE UYGULAMADA EGITIM BILIMLERI
AB The aim of this study was to provide a better understanding of ICT teachers assigned position and to determine school administrators' and other teachers' perceptions towards ICT teachers and these teachers' positions, and to reveal the similar and discrepant aspects of their tertiary education and the roles (work and responsibilities) assigned to them in schools. For this purpose, a qualitative case study research design was used. The study was conducted within three phases. In the first phase, focus group interview with 2 faculty members at department of Computer Education and Instructional Technologies and 6 ICT teachers, in the second phase, a pilot study encompassing an interview with 2 teachers from other branches and 1 school administrators, and finally face-to-face interviews with 33 participants, 10 of whom were school administrators, 11 of whom were ICT teachers, 12 of whom were teachers from other branches. The data obtained were analyzed using content analysis, and the findings showed that ICT teachers undertook many roles in their schools apart from the assigned positions determined by MoNE. The fundamental reason for this appeared that ICT teachers were perceived as an expert, a technical staff or a personnel who knows everything about ICT. Further, there occurred some differences and ambiguities between the education they took and the assigned roles and due to these ambiguities that even the ICT teachers could hardly define their assigned roles in schools was observed.
