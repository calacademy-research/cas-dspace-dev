We're almost done cleaning up the fields for the Library DAM, and we noticed that there are a set of
 records that have the creation date embedded in the creator field, ex.  T.M. Gosliner 01 Jun 1998.
 I looked in the records, and the date isn't recorded anywhere else. Is it possible to extract
 the dates from these fields and add them to the create date field?  I've attached a csv file
 of the fields we noticed (about ~130).


1: Identify which fields we want to retain
I am in agreement with you about what to retain:
    Collection [we should tag]
    Date Created -> dc.date.created
    Rights Holder -> dc.rights.holder
    Title -> dc.title
    Creator -> dc.creator
    Phyiscal Format - was original format -> dc.format
    Geographic Location (was Coverage Geographic)
    Subject
    Asset Creation Date
    ID
NEW fields:
    Taxon  -> cas.linnean.taxon
    Common Name  -> cas.linnaean.common
    Family Name  -> cas.linnaean.family
    Description  -> cas.description
    Internal Notes -> cas.notes
    Container Information -> cas.containerinformation
    Physical Location  -> cas.physicalLocation

  'Asset Name': 'Filename'

Relevant files:
    Data Cleanup for DAM.csv - data transformations in CSV format
    Data Cleanup for DAM.csv.orig - data transformations original from library, with redundancies.
    Creator_DatesIncluded_cleanup.csv - Creator field sometimes has dates included
    data.xml - raw extraction from Cumulus; large because it contains the thumbnails inline
    cumulus-transform.rb - used to transform data.xml to an intermdiate format like:
    intermadiate_format.txt which is input for
    to_json.py which outputs
    intermediate.json

json-to-dspace:
    Takes JSON format, outputs dspace "Simple Archive Format", documented here:
